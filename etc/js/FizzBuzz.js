//? Should be easy solution. Have resolved FizzBuzz before.
//? Embarressingly forgot how module works and the logic to check "if divisible by"

//? After realizing the for loop needed to iterate through the whole array, Array.forEach implementation should work.
//? Quick realization that it's a number that constructs an array is passed into function. Will reverse the changes and reapproach

var fizzBuzz = function (n) {
  n.forEach((element) => {
    console.log(element);
  });
  return arr;
